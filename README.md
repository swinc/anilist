# Chrome Extension: Anilist Update

This is a beta (in development and undistributed!) Chrome extension for easily updating your [Anilist.co](https://anilist.co/) profile when you have completed watching a media item.

Currently this extension only attempts to identify media titles on [crunchyroll.com](https://www.crunchyroll.com/), but integrating other sites is planned.

## Download and Test

1. Download the repository (click "Code" -> "Download ZIP").
2. From Chrome -> Manage Extensions, click "Load unpacked" and **select the "app" directory** of this repository on your local machine.
3. Navigate to a supported anime site (e.g., crunchyroll.com) and test.
